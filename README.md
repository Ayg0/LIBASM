# LIBASM:
learning assembly why not doing a project at the same time
# why and what:
 in my opinion and after a year in 1337 I bilieve that learning by doing is the best way to gain the knowledge you need, so I dicided to start with a project even if it's far from my position now as a student, but it can serve as an intoduction to the assembly language, I'll be following the subject of the projects and while recreating those function and gaining more knowledge I may add other ones to the list.
