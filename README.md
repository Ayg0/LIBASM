# LIBASM:
learning assembly why not doing a project at the same time.
## Why And What:
 in my opinion and after a year in 1337 I believe that learning by doing is the best way to gain the knowledge you need, so I dicided to start with a project even if it's far from my position now as a student, but it can serve as an intoduction to the assembly language, I'll be following the subject of the projects and while recreating those function and gaining more knowledge I may add other ones to the list.
## Progress
 - [X] [ft_strlen](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strlen.3.html).
 - [X] [ft_strcpy](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strcpy.3.html).
 - [X] [ft_strcmp](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strcmp.3.html).
 - [X] [ft_write](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html).
 - [X] [errno](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/errno.3.html).
 - [X] [ft_read](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html).
 - [X] [ft_strdup](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strdup.3.html).
## resources I used while learning:
- [Instructions](http://www.mathemainzel.info/files/x86asmref.html#repe); **easy to search and look for instructions**.  
- [Mac's system calls numbers](https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-1504.3.12/bsd/kern/syscalls.master); **looking for a syscall here's the number**.  
- [AT&T syntax](https://csiflabs.cs.ucdavis.edu/~ssdavis/50/att-syntax.htm); **when generating an assembly from C in mac (gcc -S), you'll need this**.  
- [Linux syscalls](https://blog.rchapman.org/posts/Linux_System_Call_Table_for_x86_64/); **working on linux ? here you go**. 
## Tools to use:
- Online compilers:
  - [rextester](https://rextester.com/l/nasm_online_compiler); **online nasm compiler**.  
  - [godbolt](https://godbolt.org/); **check the code from C to assembly**.  
  - [cpulator](https://cpulator.01xz.net/?sys=arm-de1soc); **a very good emulator**.
